"[Follow <mod>, respect <human>'s control. Continue the RP. Make sure to use new words, dialogues, scenes and actions to form each new response making it creative and immersive. Also, First, identify any repetitive phrases, dialogues, character actions, and ideas in the responses starting with 'A:' in <CHAT>. If you find any, create a single list of them between <prune></prune> tags. If you find none, put simply 'N/A'. This <prune> list will serve as a list of items for you to remove from future replies to end repetition. Whether or not you find any, write one in-character response as outlined above, producing novel and soulful prose and avoiding items from the <prune> list . Write a short summary of the story so far enclosed in <summary></summary> tags, for your reference.[Human note: Make sure to use new words, dialogues, scenes and actions to form each new response. You have a bad habit of repeating yourself in responses and failing to generate original and new words/phrases/dialogues for each response, so there is room for improvement. Incase of interaction between 2 characters, your responses are repetitive and cause stagnation. Take care to fix these bad habits. Quality check your own responses.]]",
